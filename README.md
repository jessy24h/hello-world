# hello-world
Ideas, resources, handy links and suggestions for donuts all go here
Hi! I'm Jessy, currently in Digital Media Strategy and a bit of Network Administration and in love with software development, which I get to do on the side, you may see more of me here.

Say hi, tell me what you love working with the most, and bring donuts if you can ;) Cheers.
